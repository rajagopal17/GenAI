***Llama-index advanced retrievers with opensource llm (mistral):***

***Business case:***  Organizations have large amounts of proprietary data in shared drives. Timely access of such data in a organized way is usually a challenge
and takes lot of time and resources.  If we can build a application which can answer the queries and point to the right documents it will really help to save time and efforts
of employees.

**Platform used**: RAG (Retreival augmented generation) apllication provided by llama-index platform provided very efficient tools for search and query huge amounts of data
               Also i have used open source llm -Mistral provided by togetherAPI

**Project:** Implementing LLMIndex in a RAG Application
In this project, we have indexed SAP documentation (multiple pdf files) . By indexing the documents we can efficiently search for various sub-modules, technical names,
configuration steps and other details without having to read the entire document. We can query the database with simple questions in natural language and get the answers.

***Conclusion:***
LlamaIndex serves as a powerful tool in the arsenal of RAG applications by providing advanced text mining 
capabilities that enable fast and accurate processing of vast amounts of unstructured data. Its flexibility and advanced 
search functionalities make it an indispensable asset for organizations looking to improve their risk assessment, grading,
and overall decision-making processes.
